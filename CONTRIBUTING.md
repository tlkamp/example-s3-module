# Contributing
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests and accept pull requests.

## We Use Semantic Versioning + Commitizen
This project is commitizen-friendly. We use semantic versioning for this repository and adhering to conventional commits makes the release process easier.


Follow the guide for working with Commitizen [here](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).

There is a pre-commit hook included in this repository. To use it, simply copy `prepare-commit-msg` into `.git/hooks/`.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). 
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed inputs, outputs or behavior, update the documentation.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Make sure your commits are conventional.
5. Open that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Use `terraform fmt -recursive` to keep code style clean and consistent.
